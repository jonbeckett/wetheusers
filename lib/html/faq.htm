<h3>What is "WeTheUsers" ?</h3>
<p>WeTheUsers could be described as a blog, a microblog, and a social network. It has aspects of all these things. Perhaps it is best described as a community. A community anybody can join, and share their thoughts, their opinions, and their stories with as few, or as many people as they wish.</p>

<h3>Where can I find out about the latest changes to the site ?</h3>
<p>All design and development changes are posted by the creator of the site - <strong><a href="/WeTheUsers">WeTheUsers</a></strong>, with the tag <strong><a href="/explore/tag/wetheusers">wetheusers</a></strong>.</p>

<h3>How do I post stuff?</h3>
<p>Once you are logged in, visit the <strong><a href="http://wetheusers.net/post/add">Compose</a></strong> page. You will notice that posts use "markdown" to format text - if you're stuck on it, do a quick google search - it's very, very easy.</p>

<h3>How do I edit what I have written?</h3>
<p>Click on the title of the post (or photo, or date posted), and the "single post" view will have an edit link. Notice you can also remove any comments from your own posts.</p>

<h3>How does the privacy work?</h3>
<p>When you write a post, you can choose for it to be either "public", or "friends only". If you choose "friends only", only people YOU have marked as a friend will see the post. If people have marked you as a friend, but you have not reciprocated, they will not see your "friends only" posts.</p>

<h3>Why are the site's terms so strict?</h3>
<p>The terms are strict in terms of the kinds of content you can share because we want to create an inclusive environment. 	We would also like to avoid having to take down content if at all possible for legal reasons. Please be responsible in the content you share on the site. Remember you can always set posts to "friends only" if worried that content might offend others, but please keep within the law in the words and images you post.</p>

<h3>What shows on the front page?</h3>
<p>Before you register, or login to the site, popular content from the last 7 days is shown on the front page, judged by the number of likes each post has. Once you are logged in, if you have not chosen any friends yet, you are still shown the popular posts. Once you have chosen some friends, the front page will show yours and their posts.</p>

<h3>How do I find people to follow?</h3>
<p>If you are new to the site, and don't know anybody, the best place to start is the <strong><a href="/explore/directory">Directory</a></strong>, which lists users by tags they have chosen to be found under. Next up are the <strong><a href="/explore/popular">Popular Posts</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="/explore/firehose">Firehose</a></strong> pages, which show recent content. Another option is the <strong><a href="/tags">Tags</a></strong> page, where you can find posts tagged with a particular term that you might be interested in. If you find an author you like, click on their photo or name to visit their profile page, and you may find other posts they have written. They may also list links to the other people they follow (it's an option in each member's account page).</p>

<h3>I don't like the tiled layout of posts - can I see them as a list?</h3>
<p>Yes you can. If you are logged into the site, there will be two buttons at the foot of any page showing lots of posts - "Tile Mode", and "List Mode". Your choice will be remembered for the remainder of your session at the site.</p>

<h3>How does Messaging Work?</h3>
<p>You can send private messages to anybody in the site that has marked you as a friend. The button to send somebody a message appears in their profile page when they have marked you as a friend.</p>

<H3>How do I find out what's been going on with my friends, and posts?</h3>
<p>In the <strong><a href="/messages">Messages</a></strong> section, there is a tab called "<strong><a href="/messages/notifications">Notifications</a></strong>" that shows all activity relating to you in the site. Events are kept for 7 days. In reality, event log messages are just the same as other messages, but written to you by the system.</p>

<h3>Why does the site look so bad in older versions of Internet Explorer?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately Internet Explorer uses a number of proprietary CSS tags, which we are not prepared to pollute the site's stylesheet with. If in the future enough users arrive that want to use Internet Explorer, we will perhaps make a specific stylesheet for it. At the moment, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari all work wonderfully on the desktop. The Google Nexus 7 and Apple iPad tablets work wonderfully, and most mobile phones work well too. Internet Explorer is the only browser that causes trouble, fully deserving of it's awful reputation in the web development community.</p>

<h3>Why am I having problems uploading images?</h3>
<p>Many people have experienced problems uploading images from mobile phones and tablet computers. To start with, there is a 2Mb file upload limit, governed by the memory limit of the web server (put in place to protect the stability of the platform). Also, you may find that particular mobile phone browsers cannot use the HTML "file" element (which is crazy, because it's been around for at least 15 years).</p>

<h3>Why did the site lock me out after I updated the account page?</h3>
<p>The webserver (in common with most webservers) looks for URLs in the data you send to the site. If you ignore the instructions on the account page, and fill out the social media fields with the full URL of each service instead of the users, you will find yourself locked out for 20 minutes or so, because the webserver thinks you are a spammer.</p>

<h3>Are there any plans to make an iOS or Android app?</h3>
<p>Not at the moment, although a full API may be defined at some point, allowing third parties to build their own applications. At the moment, a major effort has been made to ensure the site works well in mobile device browsers.</p>
